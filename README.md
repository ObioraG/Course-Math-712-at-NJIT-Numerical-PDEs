# Math 712-Numerical PDEs
Course Description: Numerical methods for the solution of initial- and boundary-value problems for partial
differential equations, with emphasis on finite difference methods. Consistency, stability, convergence, and
implementation are considered.

Course Outline
1. Review of classification of PDEs, Fourier analysis of PDEs, symbols of operators, dispersion
relations, well posedness of initial-value and initial-boundary-value problems for model PDEs
2. Numerical differentiation on a grid
3. Some simple explicit & implicit Finite Difference (FD) numerical schemes for the model
PDEs
4. The concepts of Order of Accuracy, Stability, Consistency and Convergence of numerical
schemes
5. Fourier analysis on a grid. The Evaluation and Truncation operators.
6. Stability of single- and multi-step FD schemes. Introduction to the effect of boundary
conditions
7. Dispersion and Dissipation of FD schemes
8. Schemes for Hyperbolic and Parabolic PDEs and systems in 1 and 2 dimensions
9. Stability analysis of Initial Boundary Value Problems for PDEs
10. Applications to model linear and nonlinear (Newton iteration) PDEs
